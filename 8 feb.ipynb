    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> The fourth pillar of OOP is Abstraction. Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example --> Think of a car; the actual mechanism that keeps a car moving is hidden from the user. It is important to know how to drive a car; but it is not necessarily important to know what happens under the hood when you drive the car. Abstraction is about keeping the internal mechanics of the code hidden from the user. This reduces the complexity of the code, and ensures that we only concentrate on what is important."

    "\n",
    "The main goal of the abstract base class is to provide a standardized way to test whether an object adheres to a given specification. It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesnâ€™t override a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance."

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer --> There are several ways to achieve data abstraction, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This involves encapsulating the data and operations that manipulate the data in a single unit, called a class. The class provides an interface to access and manipulate the data, while the implementation details are hidden from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create a new class by inheriting properties and methods from an existing class. By creating a new class with a simpler interface that inherits from a more complex class, you can achieve data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same type. This makes it possible to write code that can operate on a wide range of objects without needing to know their specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: An interface is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement. By defining an interface for a data type, you can separate the interface from the implementation and achieve data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but can be used as a base class for other classes. By defining abstract classes with a simplified interface, you can achieve data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using one or more of these techniques, you can achieve data abstraction in your software system, which can help to make your code more maintainable, reusable, and easier to understand."
